# C - Simple Shell
### C Programming Group Project
By: Julien Barbier, co-founder & CEO

## description
This project is a culmination of the concepts and techniques learnt so far in  the ALX C programming month 0 and 1 course. It aims to demonstrate proficiency in C programming and problem-solving skills. This is a group project that focuses on building a shell done by Yvonne Oyinda and Segun Ojo.

This is one of the most anticipated project and also one that will challenge you a lot about everything you have learnt so far:
* Basics of programming
* Basics of C
* Basics of thinking like an engineer
* Group work
* and Learning how to learn

#### man or help: ####
* sh (Run sh as well)

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
* Who designed and implemented the original Unix operating system
* Who wrote the first version of the UNIX shell
* Who invented the B programming language (the direct predecessor to the C programming language)
* Who is Ken Thompson
* How does a shell work
* What is a pid and a ppid
* How to manipulate the environment of the current process
* What is the difference between a function and a system call
* How to create processes
* What are the three prototypes of main
* How does the shell use the PATH to find the programs
* How to execute another program with the execve system call
* How to suspend the execution of a process until one of its children terminates
* What is EOF / “end-of-file”?

### List of allowed functions and system calls
* access (man 2 access)
* chdir (man 2 chdir)
* close (man 2 close)
* closedir (man 3 closedir)
* execve (man 2 execve)
* exit (man 3 exit)
* _exit (man 2 _exit)
* fflush (man 3 fflush)
* fork (man 2 fork)
* free (man 3 free)
* getcwd (man 3 getcwd)
* getline (man 3 getline)
* getpid (man 2 getpid)
* isatty (man 3 isatty)
* kill (man 2 kill)
* malloc (man 3 malloc)
* open (man 2 open)
* opendir (man 3 opendir)
* perror (man 3 perror)
* read (man 2 read)
* readdir (man 3 readdir)
* signal (man 2 signal)
* stat (\_\_xstat) (man 2 stat)
* lstat (\_\_lxstat) (man 2 lstat)
* fstat (\_\_fxstat) (man 2 fstat)
* strtok (man 3 strtok)
* wait (man 2 wait)
* waitpid (man 2 waitpid)
* wait3 (man 2 wait3)
